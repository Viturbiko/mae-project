				<h1>Objectives of</h1>
				<h2>integration, sustainability and greening technologies in transport</h2>
				<p>Due to the constant increase of international trade over the last thirty years the European Union (EU) has been faced with a number of social and environmental challenges addressing the negative impacts of freight mobility. In this context, the need to foster a sustainable freight transport market behavior reducing the external costs of transport has become a major goal, firmly addressed in the EU policy.</p>
				<p>From today’s perspective, and partly due to a smart combination of regulatory and financial measures performing together as a sort of “stick and carrot” mechanism, the transport market is performing better than in the past in many aspects.</p>
				<p>However, there are plenty socio-environmental challenges ahead for all modes of transport. Decarbonisation is now in the upfront of the international agenda. For the first time, the maritime sector is facing real targets for CO2 emissions reduction after the recent adoption by the International Maritime Organization of the initial strategy on decarbonization in shipping. As well, the insufficient contribution of road transport to overall CO2 emissions reduction is on the debate within legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles, currently under revision. Air pollutant reduction targets are also getting stricter from the environmental regulation and extended to all modes of transport. In particular, this is a short-term challenge for the maritime industry by 2020 with the entry into force of the new Sulphur cap on marine fuels, whereas road transport has already made great improvements following the implementation of the EURO class regulation. However, road transport generates a number of social impacts, related mainly to congestion and accidents, that are still to be reduced.</p>

				<p>With the CEF Regulation under revision for the next period and the TEN-t policy to be starting the revision process in the short term, it seems the right time for the debate on possible approaches to tacklethese socio-environmental issues coming in the next years while securing the conditions for the further transport market development and competitiveness.</p>
				
				<p>In this context, the Med Atlantic Ecobonus (MAE) Action is an institutional study co-financed by the European Union with this main goals:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>To set up a debate on a possible common EU approach on eco-incentive schemes to stimulate a sustainable freight transport market behavior. The approach is intended to be transferable to all modes of transport and EU regions. If broad consensus were to be achieved, these eco-incentive schemes could become a part of the EU funding priorities, as eligible actions within the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 (i.e. CEF2).</li>
					<br>
					<li>To perform a complete ex-ante analysis, taken the case of the Motorways of the Sea (MoS) as example to prove the impacts of the proposed approach (MAE example).</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The MAE common EU approach -open to the debate- stablishes the following main principles that schemes shall comply to get the EU funding support:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Targeted to mature markets. Not intended to start-up services, to compensate market losses or to pure modal shift goals (different approach from Marco Polo programmes)</li>
					<li>Stimulating a sustainable freight transport market behavior</li>
					<li>Incentive calculation based exclusively on demonstrated socio-environmental merits reducing negative externalities in transport (i.e. measuring external costs savings is needed based on common references -EC’s Handbook of Transport External Costs-)</li>
					<li>Technologically agnostic on how the socio-environmental merit is achieved</li>
					<li>With the funding being conditioned to results</li>
					<li>Demonstrating performance achieved (i.e. monitoring)</li>
					<li>With the MS being the promoters of the schemes (regional approach) and those who mobilize and implement the necessary budget (as with the national schemes) provided there is EU co-financing.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition to these principles, granting any financial support shall be conditional to an “ex-ante” analysis showing in advance the impacts of the scheme to assess the impacts of the eco-incentive measure in the targeted market. The simulation must be carried out with the use of relevant tools based on common references, developed ad hoc for the targeted market and limited through eligibility criteria. As a result, the “ex-ante” analysis shall demonstrate the impacts of the scheme and the budgetary needs.</p>

				<h2>Following this approach, the main features of the MAE example are:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Targeted Market: MoS servicing alternative routes to the road transport in the West-Mediterranean and Atlantic regions.</li> 
					<li>Goal: Triggering green actions in the maritime leg (improving environmental performance of vessels)</li>
					<li>Socio-Environmental Merit incentivized: The external cost savings from a truck using a maritime service compared to the ‘road-only’ route.</li> 
					<li>The road transport receives the eco-incentive when using the maritime service. The eco-incentive is directed through demand (Italian ecobonus approach)</li> 
					<li>Only for maritime services adopting green actions (technology or not technology based)</li> 
					<li>An external cost calculator tool has been developed specifically for the targeted market to measure the environmental merit which is incentivized, as described. This calculator is based on the latest update available of the EC’ Handbook of External Costs.</li> 
				</ul>

				<p>Moving to real implementing Actions needs broad consensus at all levels. If the approach is accepted, the MAE Action could end up being the basis for further EU support to the development of the sustainable freight transport services component of the TEN-t.</p>

				<p>Therefore, getting feedback and building consensus with the relevant stakeholders is of outmost importance for the Action If you wish to submit a written contribution, please send it to: mae.project@puertos.es</p>
