				<h1>Objectives of</h1>
				<h2>integration, sustainability and greening technologies in transport</h2>
				<p>2013 guidelines for the further development of the Transeuropean Transport Network (TEN-t) introduced a new approach towards a true network dimension of the common transport system, departing from the isolated projects approach to the comprehensive and core networks dimension. Moreover, the corridors have proved to be a very effective tool to support this network approach.</p>
				<p>Also, the objectives of integration, sustainability and greening technologies in transport are firmly addressed in the TEN-t regulation as a means of reducing the negative impacts of the transport activity on the environment.</p>
				<p>In this context, the 2013 guidelines brought the further development of sustainable freight transport services as part of the network contributing to a more efficient and greener transport, including the motorways of the sea. Thus, complementing a pure infrastructural approach, as in the past.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, environment is currently one of the major challenges for transport operators in the ever-increasing strict regulation aiming at reducing polluting emissions and stopping the climate change, with an immediate impact on the maritime transport regarding the regulation on Sulphur content of the maritime fuel entering into force by 2020.</p>
				<p>In this context, the Med Atlantic Ecobonus (MAE) Action is an institutional study co-financed by the European
				Union and performing a comprehensive analysis on the potential use of eco-incentives measures to stimulate sustainable freight transport services in the current TEN-t framework and further CEF mechanism for the 2021-2027 period, open to all EU regions and modes of transport.</p>

				<h1>As a result</h1>
				<h2>MAE Action proposes an approach to eco-incentives based on common principles at EU level and delivering,</h2>
				<p>as example, an ex-ante analysis for the particular case of the motorways of, the sea (MoS) market servicing alternative routes for the road transport in the Atlantic and West Mediterranean regions, demonstrating the impact.</p>
				<p>The example is taking over the recommendations of the Sulphur Directive to avoid negative effects on modal (back) shift as a direct consequence of the increase in the price of the maritime ticket.</p>
				<p>During the final event of the MAE Action the results of the study will be presented. Moreover, the event will be a good opportunity to debate on the further EU support to sustainable freight transport services.</p>
